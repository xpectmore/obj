obj - ANOTHER D.O.M. browser




This is ANOTHER d.o.m. browser destinated to serve the jquery plugins programmers 
special for people they develop jquery plugins based to d.o.m. on first level
without using jquery functions just pure javascript with d.o.m. 
			     
***Installing:                                            
	Just load jquery first (i used jquery-2.1.0.min.js,
so the script is not tested yet to others versions),
then obj.js, so loading the scripts when document finish to load
just call obj function.

eg. I am interested to see the d.o.m. section of `window` object  
i call it :
	$.obj(window,'window')
